What happens when you need to initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?

Git creates the metadata for your repository, with no file tracked. Without 
creating the metadata Git cannot work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a list of files ready to be committed. Not all files in a 
working directory will be commited, and a reposity is a logical concept--
snapshots of all the commits that Git remembers. It allows you to add or remove
files from the next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can add the modified files per commit to the staging area. If they are not 
added they will not be commited.
