When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
files local?

When you don't have Git or access to an editor on the machine you are working 
on.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

Because you only want commits to be logical changes. Auto-commiting doesn't 
allow for that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you 
use one instead of the other.

A fork is a GitHub feature to copy a repository from another user. A clone 
copies a repository, local or remote. There are multiple branches in a  
repository that allows you to experiment with working code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally.
It allows you to merge changes when the branches automatically diverge.
